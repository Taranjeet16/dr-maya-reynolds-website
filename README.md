Dr. Maya Reynolds – Therapy Website

This project is a responsive website for Dr. Maya Reynolds, a licensed therapist based in Austin, Texas.
It was built as part of an internship assignment focused on frontend accuracy, design judgment, and content adaptation.

A pixel-accurate homepage clone (structure-first)
A full creative redesign using a therapist profile as the single source of truth
Custom copy, imagery, and an additional section not present in the original template

Recreate an existing homepage layout with high visual accuracy
Redesign the site with a new theme, typography, imagery, and copy

🛠 Tech Stack

🎨 Design & Content Notes
The color palette and typography were chosen to feel calm, warm, and trustworthy—appropriate for a therapy practice.
All copy is written in a client-centered, non-clinical tone.
Calls to action route intentionally to contact or resources pages (no backend logic implemented).
Images are used intentionally to support the emotional tone of each section.

🤖 AI Usage
AI tools were used to assist with initial layout scaffolding and iteration speed.
All spacing, copy, imagery, and structural decisions were reviewed and refined manually to ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with the therapist’s profile.
